Hi, I am Sailesh Dev. I was introduced to programming like many others during my school days. I still remember the very first program I wrote - I inputed the user's favourite color and displayed it on the screen. It was a very simple program, but I still remember the joy that spined down my legs when I could build something myself. It is beautiful and artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture. This started my remarkable journey and began a new chapter in life.

My dream is to identify real social problems and address them. Philanthrophy is not the perfect solution, it shouldn't become a way to shrug off our responsibilities. It appeases our consciences. We need to revolutionize the fishing industry instead of offering a fish or teaching how to fish. Setting oneself up in a position to dedicate their time to a social mission in this manner can require a complete bootstrapping of one's life. It can involve losing much of social life, living off of credit cards, facing the real possibility of going homeless, and so on. All that being said, while it can be hard, there's a very big difference between something being hard, and something being impossible. Nothing great ever comes easy, and those who step on this path would not be on it for very long if they were not driven by a true love and passion for humanity. I am extremely lucky and fortunate in life. I found my passion early and I love what I do. 

I am currently pursuing bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering at VIT University, India. I am a full-stack developer and a machine learning enthusiast. I push most of my code to GitHub and a true believer of "open-source technologies". I love apple drinks and have a weakness for the taste of caffeine.
